# GTML - Gmoney Text Markup Language

HTML can be confusing with words like HREF and SRC and weird mix-ups like an include tag is named, "link", while an actual link is named, "a". GTML fixes that and even builds your code into HTML when you're done! GTML was created by **Grant Weadon** and is protected by **FlappyGrant Studios** ([www.flappygrant.com](https://www.flappygrant.com)).

## Features

GTML includes formatting and text color support for .GTML and .GTM files, but **THE COMPILER IS NOT INCLUDED BY DEFAULT!!!** Find out how to install the compiler in the requirements section.

## Requirements

* Install the compiler [here](https://gtml.flappygrant.com/releases.html).
* Do what the notes below the releases tell you to do.

## Known Issues

* Only Windows supports the debugger due to Python and PyInstaller issues.
* The compiler is still in beta, so not all tags are implimented. The debugger contains a .MD file with the current tags.
* The script tag works with the code in between the tag and the url attribute but works better with the second option.

## Release Notes

I will update the below every time GTML updates.

### BETA 1.0.0
